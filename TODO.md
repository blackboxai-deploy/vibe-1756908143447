# OCR PDF Text Extraction - Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Dependencies
- [x] Install required dependencies (pdf2pic, sharp, formidable)
- [x] Create main page component with upload interface
- [x] Set up file upload utilities and validation

## Phase 2: Core Components
- [x] Build FileUpload component with drag-and-drop
- [x] Create ProgressTracker component for processing status
- [x] Build TextViewer component for results display
- [x] Create ExportOptions component for downloads

## Phase 3: Backend API Development
- [x] Create main OCR processing API endpoint
- [x] Implement PDF to image conversion service
- [x] Build OCR service with AI integration
- [x] Create text formatting and structuring utilities
- [ ] Add status tracking and progress endpoints

## Phase 4: AI Integration
- [x] Integrate GPT-4 Vision API for handwriting recognition
- [x] Implement custom prompts for text extraction
- [x] Add batch processing for large files
- [x] Set up multimodal content processing

## Phase 5: Testing & Optimization
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) â†’ AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing
- [ ] Install dependencies and build application
- [ ] Start server and test file upload functionality
- [ ] Test OCR processing with sample PDF
- [ ] Validate text extraction and export features
- [ ] API testing with curl commands
- [ ] Performance testing with large files

## Phase 6: Final Validation
- [ ] Complete end-to-end testing
- [ ] Verify all export formats work correctly
- [ ] Test progress tracking and error handling
- [ ] Final browser testing and UI validation
